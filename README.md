# ARS-CNN
Augmented Random Search Algorithm Framework. Supports OpenAI gym and custom enviroments. Built around the work of [Simple random search provides a competitive approach
to reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07055.pdf) this framework allows for the use of CNN's for feature inputs to the ARS algorithm. It also extends use by allowing user to easily specify their own custom enviroment.
